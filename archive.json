In my experience, we benefit more from the semantic content of a field, rather than the properties of it like length. Reducing log size by omitting fields is a useful technique for a few reasons (storage and processing). \n\n",

      "body": "In theory, its possible to support different MoQ sessions in a single QUIC connection that is using WebTransport. \n\nOur awkwardly named \"[Usage with QUIC](https://lpardue.github.io/draft-pardue-moq-qlog-moq-events/draft-pardue-moq-qlog-moq-events.html#name-usage-with-quic)\" section has some text related to this (sort of)\n\n> If used without QUIC events, it is recommended that the implementation assign a globally unique identifier to each MOQT session. This ID can then be used as the value of the qlog \"group_id\" field, as well as the qlog filename or file identifier, potentially suffixed by the vantagepoint type (For example, abcd1234_server.qlog would contain the server-side trace of the connection with GUID abcd1234).\n\nI say sort of, because even with QUIC events, its probably useful to be able to assign MoQ events to a session.\n\nIn the absence of a qlog for WebTransport, I'm not sure _exactly_ what to do at this stage and suspect we might want to punt for now until some experience.\n\nSpecifically, each MoQ qlog event can (via the [abstract base class](https://quicwg.org/qlog/draft-ietf-quic-qlog-main-schema.html#section-7)) set a `group_id` (not to be confused with MoQ groups). So for instance, we could have something like MOQTSessionCreated / MOQTSessionTerminated events, to make it explicit about the lifetime of the session and within them uniquely identify the group that was created. Then, each related event is marked with that identifier in the base `group_id`.\n\nAnother idea is to just do this implicitly by relying on stream IDs (and for datagrams, the quarter stream ID) and relying on events from the QUIC and HTTP/3 qlog to \"tie\" things together more implicility. I don't like this idea much since the locality of log entries is not guaranteed, and stateful parsing of logs add friction to log processing. For example, if you want to \"give me all the data and control messages for a session\" its a lot easier if you can just grep for a field like `\"group_id\": \"mycoolsession\"`",

The rationale being that while the wire image needs to carry mandatory fields, logging often doesn't need or want to for size and data minimization reasons.\r\n\r\nMy mistake has been to approach optional logging by mandating a `raw` field and allowing the optional internal fields to be omitted. But that just means that logs get full up with empty raw fields, which is sort of pointless. I'd rather we make raw field consistently optional. In addition, where it makes sense, allow logging a specific field for strings or hex-encoded bytestrings so they are more easily consumed.",
