1.  Introduction

   This document defines a qlog event schema (Section 8 of [QLOG-MAIN])
   containing concrete events for Media over QUIC Transport [MOQT].

   The event namespace with identifier moqt is defined; see Section 3.
   In this namespace multiple events derive from the qlog abstract Event
   class (Section 7 of [QLOG-MAIN]), each extending the "data" field and
   defining their "name" field values and semantics.

   Table 1 summarizes the name value of each event type that is defined
   in this specification.  Some event data fields use complex data
   types.  These are represented as enums or re-usable definitions,
   which are grouped together on the bottom of this document for
   clarity.

1.1.  Usage with QUIC

   The events described in this document can be used with or without
   logging the related QUIC events defined in [QLOG-QUIC].  If used with
   QUIC events, the QUIC document takes precedence in terms of
   recommended filenames and trace separation setups.

   If used without QUIC events, it is recommended that the
   implementation assign a globally unique identifier to each MOQT
   session.  This ID can then be used as the value of the qlog
   "group_id" field, as well as the qlog filename or file identifier,
   potentially suffixed by the vantagepoint type (For example,
   abcd1234_server.qlog would contain the server-side trace of the
   connection with GUID abcd1234).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The event and data structure definitions in ths document are
   expressed in the Concise Data Definition Language [CDDL] and its
   extensions described in [QLOG-MAIN].

   The following fields from [QLOG-MAIN] are imported and used: name,
   namespace, type, data, group_id, RawInfo, and time-related fields.

   Events are defined with an importance level as described in
   Section 8.3 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   As is the case for [QLOG-MAIN], the qlog schema definitions in this
   document are intentionally agnostic to serialization formats.  The
   choice of format is an implementation decision.

3.  Event Schema Definition

   This document describes how the MOQT protocol is expressed in qlog
   with an event schema.  Per the requirements in Section 8 of
   [QLOG-MAIN], this document registers the moqt namespace.  The event
   schema URI is urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:moqt.

3.1.  Draft Event Schema Identification

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   Only implementations of the final, published RFC can use the events
   belonging to the event schema with the URI
   urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:moqt.  Until such an RFC exists,
   implementations MUST NOT identify themselves using this URI.

   Implementations of draft versions of the event schema MUST append the
   string "-" and the corresponding draft number to the URI.  For
   example, draft 99 of this document is identified using the URI
   urn:ietf:params:qlog:events:moqt-99.

   The namespace identifier itself is not affected by this requirement.

4.  MOQT Events

   MOQT events extend the $ProtocolEventData extension point defined in
   [QLOG-MAIN].  Additionally, they allow for direct extensibility by
   their use of per-event extension points via the $$ CDDL "group
   socket" syntax, as also described in [QLOG-MAIN].

   MOQTEventData = MOQTControlMessageCreated /
                   MOQTControlMessageParsed /
                   MOQTStreamTypeSet /
                   MOQTObjectDatagramCreated /
                   MOQTObjectDatagramParsed /
                   MOQTSubgroupHeaderCreated /
                   MOQTSubgroupHeaderParsed /
                   MOQTSubgroupObjectCreated /
                   MOQTSubgroupObjectParsed /
                   MOQTFetchHeaderCreated /
                   MOQTFetchHeaderParsed /
                   MOQTFetchObjectCreated /
                   MOQTFetchObjectParsed

   $ProtocolEventData /= MOQTEventData

     Figure 1: MOQTEventData definition and ProtocolEventData extension

   MOQT events are logged when a certain condition happens at the
   application layer, and there isn't always a one to one mapping
   between HTTP and QUIC events.  The exchange of data between the HTTP
   and QUIC layer is logged via the "stream_data_moved" and
   "datagram_data_moved" events in [QLOG-QUIC].

   The concrete MOQT event types are further defined below, their type
   identifier is the heading name.

   Some MOQT messages include a reason phrase that can provide
   additional information in the format of a byte sequences.  However,
   these sequences are not guaranteed to be presentable as UTF-8.  In
   order to accomodate various encodings, where the wire image of a
   message includes a reason phrase, the MOQT qlog event type, includes
   two option fields: reason (for UTF-8) and reason_bytes (a hex-encoded
   string representing raw bytes).  Implementations SHOULD log at least
   one format, but MAY log both or none.

4.1.  control_message_created

   The control_message_created event is emitted when a control message
   is created.  It has Core importance level.

   The definition of control message content is in Section 5.7.

   MOQTControlMessageCreated = {
       stream_id: uint64
       ? length: uint16
       message: $MOQTControlMessage
       ? raw: RawInfo

       * $$moqt-controlmessagecreated-extension
   }

               Figure 2: MOQTControlMessageCreated definition

4.2.  control_message_parsed

   The control_message_parsed event is emitted when a control message is
   parsed.  It has Core importance level.

   The definition of control message content is in Section 5.7.

   MOQTControlMessageParsed = {
       stream_id: uint64
       ? length: uint16
       message: $MOQTControlMessage
       ? raw: RawInfo

       * $$moqt-controlmessageparsed-extension
   }

               Figure 3: MOQTControlMessageParsed definition

4.3.  stream_type_set

   The stream_type_set event conveys when a MOQT stream type becomes
   known.  It has Base importance level.

   MOQTStreamTypeSet = {
       ? owner: Owner
       stream_id: uint64
       stream_type: $MOQTStreamType

       * $$moqt-streamtypeset-extension
   }

   $MOQTStreamType /=  "control" /
                       "subgroup_header" /
                       "fetch_header"

                   Figure 4: MOQTStreamTypeSet definition

4.4.  object_datagram_created

   The object_datagram_created event is emitted when the OBJECT_DATAGRAM
   message is created.  It has Core importance level.

   MOQTObjectDatagramCreated = {
       track_alias: uint64
       group_id: uint64
       ? object_id: uint64
       publisher_priority: uint8
       ? extension_headers_length: uint64
       ? extension_headers: [* MOQTExtensionHeader]
       ? object_status: uint64
       ? object_payload: RawInfo
       end_of_group: bool

       * $$moqt-objectdatagramcreated-extension
   }

               Figure 5: MOQTObjectDatagramCreated definition

   The object_datagram_parsed event is emitted when the OBJECT_DATAGRAM
   message is parsed.  It has Core importance level.

   MOQTObjectDatagramParsed = {
       track_alias: uint64

   }

               Figure 6: MOQTObjectDatagramParsed definition

4.6.  subgroup_header_created

   The subgroup_header_created event is emitted when a stream begins and
   a SUBGROUP_HEADER is created.  It has Core importance level; see
   Section 9.2 of [QLOG-MAIN].

   The SUBGROUP_HEADER object in MoQT uses 12 type values to encode
   various properties.  The subgroup_header_created event conveys these
   as explicit fields, such as contains_end_of_group.

   If the subgroup_id is the object_id of the first object, the
   subgroup_id is omitted.  Otherwise, it is included with the relevant
   value.

   MOQTSubgroupHeaderCreated = {
       stream_id: uint64
       track_alias: uint64
       group_id: uint64
       ? subgroup_id: uint64
       publisher_priority: uint8
       contains_end_of_group: bool

5.6.  MOQTByteString

   The MOQTByteString type allows representing MOQT bytestrings, such as

   that can be encoded in UTF-8.  The value_bytes field can be used for
   bytestrings of any type by using the hexstring encoding.

   Implementations SHOULD populate one of either the value or
   value_bytes field.  Populating both fields is redundant.

   MOQTByteString = {
